You can print cards in poker size 2.5" x 3.5" (63.5mm x 89mm) at printerstudio.
I used the printerstudio_*.sh scripts to render PNGs for that.

I ordered a batch of black cards and they look good, not perfect, but good.
See the images.
I cannot compare to original CAH cards because I don't own any.
